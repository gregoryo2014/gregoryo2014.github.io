# Why?
Why does this site exist? Largely it's because I now know that github pages are easy to maintain, and I can use markdown to do so.

## Why here?
Why is it at this address? Because XKCD is the source of a lot of humour, entertainment, interesting tidbits, utter confusion, and also wisdom. In honour of that wisdom, I consider 14 Standards a touchstone for, well, not reinventing standards all the time. I might write something more meaningful about that one day. Until then, here is the page itself.
