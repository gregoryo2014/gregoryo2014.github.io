## Why?
Why does this site exist? Largely it's because I now know that github pages are easy to maintain, and I can use jekyll and markdown to do so.

# Why here?
Why is it at this address? Because [XKCD][xkcd] is the source of a lot of humour, entertainment, interesting tidbits, confused waffling, and also wisdom. In honour of that wisdom, I consider 14 Standards a touchstone for, well, not reinventing standards all the time. I might write something more meaningful about that one day. Until then, here is the page itself.

![Fortunately, the charging one has been solved now that we've all standardized on mini-USB. Or is it micro-USB? Shit.](/assets/images/xkcd_527_standards_2x.png)
